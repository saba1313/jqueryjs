<h3>Bird FAQ - click the questions to show the answers</h3>
	<dl id="faq">
		<dt>What shouldn't I do to the bird?</dt>
		<dd>Never use oils or lotions which contain oils on your bird. They gunk up the feathers,
		and ruin their insulating properties. This means a chilled bird. Never wait out a cat bite--those
		require immediate veterinary attention--a bird can die within two days because a cat's mouth is so
		filthy and full of bacteria. Don't bother with over-the-counter medication. It really doesn't work,
		and in some cases, may upset the delicate bacterial balance in the bird's body, or even worsen the
		situation. Never try to treat a fracture at home.</dd>

		<dt>My bird is healthy. I don't need to go to a vet, do I?</dt>
		<dd>Schedule a "well-bird" checkup. Prevention is the best medicine. Even though the bird might appear outwardly healthy, it may have a low-grade infection or something not so readily apparent. Your bird's health and your peace of mind will be worth it.</dd>
		
		<dt>My bird's leg is being rubbed raw by the leg band. Can I take it off?</dt>
		<dd>No. Don't attempt this, especially if the leg is broken or swollen. The vet will be able
		to remove the band, and deal with whatever injury maybe lurking under the banded area.</dd>
	
		<dt>How do I pull a broken blood feather?</dt>
		<dd>This is probably the most common mishap. The remedy is simple--yank! It's most easily done
		with two people. One to restrain the bird and the other to pull the feather. Use pliers, or a
		hemostat. Tweezers won't work on primaries. Make certain that the wing bones are firmly supported
		or you can break the wing. Clamp onto the feather and give a sharp tug in the direction of the
		feather. The feather will come out. Next, apply gentle, direct pressure to the follicle where the
		feather was to stop the bleeding. Dab some styptic powder on it, as it will help stop the bleeding
		as well. Let the bird rest. Ask your vet or breeder to demonstrate exactly how to pull a blood
		feather if you're apprehensive about doing it.</dd>
