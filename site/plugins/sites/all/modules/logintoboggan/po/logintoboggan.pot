msgid "<p>The Login Toboggan module improves the Drupal login system by offering the following features:\n      <ol>\n      <li>Allow users to login using either their username OR their e-mail address.</li>\n      <li>Allow users to define their own password.</li>\n      <li>Allow users to login immediately.</li>\n      <li>Provide a login form on Access Denied pages for non-logged-in (anonymous) users.</li>\n      <li>The module provides two login block options: One uses JavaScript to display the form within the block immediately upon clicking \"log in\". The other brings the user to a separate page, but returns the user to their original page upon login.</li>\n      <li>Customize the registration form with two e-mail fields to ensure accuracy.</li>\n      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page when using the 'immediate login' feature.</li>\n      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page upon validation of their e-mail address.</li>\n      </ol>\n      These features may be turned on or off in the Login Toboggan <a href=\"%url\">settings</a>.</p>\n      <p>Because this module completely reorients the Drupal login process you will probably want to edit the welcome e-mail on the user settings page. For instance if you have enabled the \"Set password & Immediate Login\" option, you probably should not send the user's password out in the welcome e-mail (also note when the \"Set password & Immediate Login\" option is enabled, the %login_url becomes a verification url that the user MUST visit in order to enable authenticated status). The following is an example welcome e-mail:</p>\n      "
