TODO
- setOptions: use jQuery.extend and "data" in arguments[1], declare arguments
- allow users to keep their incomplete value when pressing tab, just mimic the default-browser-autocomplete: tab doesn't select any proposed value
- small bug in your autocomplete,  When setting autoFill:true I would expect formatResult to be called on autofill, it seems not to be the case.
- add a callback to allow decoding the response
- add scrollbars and page down/up, option for height or number of items to be visible without scrolling
- allow modification of not-last value in multiple-fields
@option Number size Limit the number of items to show at once. Default: 
@option Function parse - TEST AND DOCUMENT ME
- add option to display selectbox on focus

$input.bind("show", function() {
	if ( !select.visible() ) {
		onChange(0, true);
	}
});

  - add "try ..." hints to demo
  - check out demos
  
- add option to hide selectbox when no match is found - see comment by Ian on plugin page (14. Juli 2007 04:31)
- add example for reinitializing an autocomplete using unbind()

Thanks for a powerful and useful script :)
You may already have provided some sort of option, that I have missed, to counter the following issue. If not, I will suggest the addition of a unique generated anti cache parameter in the request function, like this:

data: jQuery.extend({
q: lastWord(term),
limit: options.max,
antiCache: new Date().getTime()
}, options.extraParams),

Otherwise especially Internet Explorer will generally reuse a cached page rather than accessing the query script, which albeit can make sense unless the data in question is frequently updated.

- Add option to pass through additional arguments to $.ajax, like type to use POST instead of GET
