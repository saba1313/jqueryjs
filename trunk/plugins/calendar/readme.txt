FEATURE REQUESTS:

"Set a flag of some kind like a class of "calendered" and only run on elements that didn't have that class. This would prevent any duplication on a given element if the call was made a second time (for dynamic content or whatever)."

"I'd like to default the calendar to a future month. This is different than a range because I don't want to prevent the user from returning to a previous month."

BUGS:

"I think I found a bug. If a set a year range (let's say for a DoB), to be '-100:-18 (so only people older than 18 can enter), the first time it works fine (the range will be between 1907-1986). but if the user goes back to the field, and the calendar pops up again, this time it will use the year in the field to calculate the range (if he chose 1980, the range will be 1880-1962)."
