Thickbox Reloaded
================================================

What's new?

* Chainable method to bind Thickbox to links and forms.
* Confirm type Thickbox, triggered by binding Thickbox to a form.
* Automatic type detection depending on type of element, respectively on type of link:
    image: href is an image
    content: href is a hash
    ajax: href is internal and not image
    iframe: href is external and not image
    confirm: element is form
* Improved UI blocking (Thanks to Mike "Malsup")
