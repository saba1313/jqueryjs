- performance tuning: add about 100 fields to custom-method-demo and profile IE
- oninvalid/invalidSubmitHandler: called after a form is validated on submit and its invalid
- removing messages by specifying null or an empty string doesn't work as it defaults to the default message. improve that check
- animations!!
- ajax validation:
	- add hint about not-available usernames to milk demo (though thats obvious by viewing source for users.php)
	- in combination with autocomplete (mustmatch company name, fill out address details, validate required)
	- validate zip code in comparison to address, if match and state is missing, fill out state
- strong password check/integration: http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/password/checker.mspx
- fix milk demo in IE6, (success) messages for radio/checkbox doesn't show up, none at all for checkbox
- add/modify onkeyup option: true - immediate, false - none

- validate on paste:

I'm going to assume that you have some validate function
"checkVal".

input.blur(checkVal);

if ($.browser.msie)
 this.onpaste= function(){setTimeout(checkVal,0);};
else if ($.browser.mozilla)
 this.addEventListener('input',checkVal,false);

- docs: update options, fix rules/messages
- custom-methods-demo.html enable summary container, currently broken, is updated too often
- stop firefox password manager to popup before validation - very very difficult

8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:30: first of all, it would be handy to have some hideError(s) method
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:31: the second thing is to provide some sort of ids not constrained only to DOM tree
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:32: it can be achieved by sniffing some character on a front of id
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:32: like # for example
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:33: by this, we'll be able to set some custom errors not strictly related to our form
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:33: for example
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:34: validator.setErrors({ '#broken_connection': 'There was a problem with connection, try again later' });
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:35: and later we could use validator.hideError('#broken_connection');

 - custom password validation, eg. 6 chars min, and at least 1 number and at least 1 alpha or Must not use 123, abc, asdf or your username or your domain in the password, see addMethod2 test
 - datepicker integration (see dobis)
 - timepicker integration ( http://labs.perifer.se/timedatepicker/ ) 
 - milk example
 - one example for each option
 - intergration with rich-text-editors (FCKEditor, TinyMCE, Codepress)
 - integration with CakePHP ( https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/2359 )
 
 -> In simple terms, you need to "move" the content from the TinyMCE
control to the textarea for validation.

$('button.save').click(function(){
	if (tinyMCE) tinyMCE.triggerSave();
});
