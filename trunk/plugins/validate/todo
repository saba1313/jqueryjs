- get testsuite to pass opera and ie6/7, consider copying triggerEvent from core testsuite
- fix errorcontainer/cancel button (errorcontainer-demo.html), add appropiate tests for each failure
- stop firefox password manager to popup before validation
- validating several checkbox groups is inconsistent (radio-checkbox-select-demo.html), sometimes it marks a group invalid when unchecking it, sometimes not
- resetForm is broken, testcase missing (ajaxSubmit-intergration-demo.html)
- custom-methods-demo.html is broken and ugly: validator.errorList has no properties

8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:30: first of all, it would be handy to have some hideError(s) method
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:31: the second thing is to provide some sort of ids not constrained only to DOM tree
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:32: it can be achieved by sniffing some character on a front of id
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:32: like # for example
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:33: by this, we'll be able to set some custom errors not strictly related to our form
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:33: for example
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:34: validator.setErrors({ '#broken_connection': 'There was a problem with connection, try again later' });
8 Sijawusz Pur Rahnama, 12:35: and later we could use validator.hideError('#broken_connection');

 -> In simple terms, you need to "move" the content from the TinyMCE
control to the textarea for validation.

$('button.save').click(function(){
	if (tinyMCE) tinyMCE.triggerSave();
});
