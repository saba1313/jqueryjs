- integrate, test and document Scott's rules modules
- add test for subformRequired
- document invalidHandler
- oninvalid/invalidSubmitHandler: called after a form is validated on submit and its invalid
- document all those event options
- is that element == lastElement check in the onblur handler really useful?
- custom-methods-demo.html enable summary container, currently broken, is updated too often

- consider validation on page load, disabling required-checks
- completely rework showErrors: manually settings errors is currently extremely flawed and utterly useless, eg. errors disappear if some other validation is triggered
- add custom event to remote validation for adding more parameters

- document focusInvalid()
- document validation lifecycle: setup (add event handlers), run validation (prepare form, validate elements, display errors/submit form)
	 -> show where the user can hook in via callbacks
	 
- AND depedency: specify multiple expressions as an array

- add custom events for form and elements instead of more callbacks (additional options/callbacks)
 - onsubmit: Boolean, default true - validate on form submit (similar to onkeyup/onblur)
 - beforeValidation: Callback, called before doing any validation
 - beforeSubmit: Callback, called before submitting the form (default submit or calling submitHandler, if specified) 

- animations!!
- ajax validation:
	- in combination with autocomplete (mustmatch company name, fill out address details, validate required)
	- validate zip code in comparison to address, if match and state is missing, fill out state
- strong password check/integration: http://phiras.wordpress.com/2007/04/08/password-strength-meter-a-jquery-plugin/

- stop firefox password manager to popup before validation - check mozilla bug tracker?

 Examples:
 - wordpress comment form, make it a drop-in method
 - ajaxForm() integration
 - ajaxSubmit with rules-option, more/less options to ajaxSubmit
 - watermark integration http://digitalbush.com/projects/watermark-input-plugin
 - datepicker integration
 - timepicker integration ( http://labs.perifer.se/timedatepicker/ ) 
 - integration with CakePHP ( https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/2359 )
 - integration with tabs: http://www.netix.sk/forms/test.html 
 - intergration with rich-text-editors (FCKEditor, TinyMCE, Codepress)
 -> In simple terms, you need to "move" the content from the TinyMCE
control to the textarea for validation.

$('button.save').click(function(){
	if (tinyMCE) tinyMCE.triggerSave();
});
